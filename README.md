# RCM-Emulator


This repository contains the main functions used to build the RCM-emulator used in:

- Doury et al. 2022, 2024
- Vlachopoulos 2024
- Balmos 2025

It is organised as follow : 

emulator_functions.py is including all function necessary to build,train and apply the emulator

training_example.py illustrates how to train the emulator. The design of the network is hidden and automatically done by the unet_maker function inside the wrapModel class

application.py illustrates how to use a trained emulator to predict.

This is a snapshot of the state of the project was in when the bachelor project was finished in July 2025.
